libmf
=====

This is an old project from a time before libfreefare worked properly for
DESFire cards (~2012). It is still used as part of some tooling for
[tuerd](https://github.com/entropia/tuerd) I couldn't be bothered to rewrite,
so I'm publishing this here.

Please, do not use this as a basis for new projects.
